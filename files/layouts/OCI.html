  </h4></div>

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 85px;">
  <p>I [Consultant Name] warrant that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, or that I have disclosed all such relevant information.</p>
  <p>I agree that if an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest is discovered after beginning of the app1url.com (formerly appDemo1.com) project, I will make a full disclosure in writing to the app1url.com customer. My disclosure shall include a description of actions, which I have taken or propose to take to avoid or mitigate the actual or potential conflict.</p>
  <p>If I am aware of an actual or potential conflict of interest prior to selection by the app1url.com client and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the app1url.com client, the client may terminate my consultancy and Government Proposal Solutions, Inc. will terminate my membership to app1url.com.</p>
  <p>I further represent that I have no past, present, or currently planned interest (financial or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed under this project that would impinge my ability to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or advice in the agreed to services.</p>
  <p>I also agree I will not compete as an offeror or as a member of another proposal or grant development team for contract, grant, tender, or agreement that involves or relates to the services provided under the above referenced contract.</p>
