</h4>
<div>

Account registration constitutes an acknowledgement that you are able to electronically receive,

</h4>
<div>
In connection with this Agreement, you may be entitled to receive certain records, such as contracts,
notices, and communications, in writing. To facilitate your use of the Site, you give us permission to
provide these records to you electronically instead of in paper form.
</div>
<h4>
YOUR CONSENT AND YOUR RIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT
</h4>
<div>
By registering for an Account, you consent to electronically receive and access, via email or the Site,
all records and notices for the services provided to you under this Agreement that we would
otherwise be required to provide to you in paper form. However, we reserve the right, in our sole
discretion, to communicate with you via the U.S. Postal Service and other third-party mail services

</div>
<h4>
MARKETPLACE FEEDBACK
</h4>
<div>
The Consumer Review Freedom Act (CRFA) reaffirms the rights of both contractors and
consultants/subject matter experts to post truthful positive or negative reviews about their
experiences with a product or service. Because existing libel and slander laws cover false or
misleading statements (namely you will not be protected if you lie), Congress limited its focus on
protecting your right to talk openly online about your bad experiences without fear of reprisals.
For the benefit of other Users of the marketplace, GPSI encourages you to leave objective balanced
feedback about Users with whom you have transacted. You acknowledge and agree that feedback
results for you will consist of comments, ratings, and other feedback left by other Users, and that
GPSI will make available to other marketplace Users, including composite feedback based on these
individual ratings. GPSI provides its public feedback system as a means through which Users can
share their opinions publicly and GPSI does not monitor or censor these opinions.
GPSI does not investigate any remarks posted by Users for accuracy or reliability but may do so if a
User requests that GPSI do so. You may be held legally responsible for damages suffered by other
Users or third parties as a result of your remarks if such remarks are libelous. GPSI is not legally
responsible for any feedback or comments posted or made available on the Site by any Users or
third parties, even if that information is defamatory or otherwise legally actionable. In order to protect
the integrity of the feedback system and protect Users from abuse, GPSI reserves the right (but is
under no obligation) to remove posted feedback or information that in GPSI’s sole judgment violates
the Terms of Service or negatively affects our operations.
</div>
<h4>
STRIPE SERVICES AGREEMENT
</h4>
<div>
Payment processing services for consultants and consultant companies on app1url.com are
provided by Stripe and are subject to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, which includes the
Stripe Terms of Service (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”). By agreeing to the Stripe
Connected Account Agreement and Stripe Terms of Service or continuing to operate as a consultant
and consultant company on app1url.com, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services
Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of
app1url.com enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide
app1url.com accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you
authorize app1url.com to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment
processing services provided by Stripe.
</div>
<h4>
ESCROW ACCOUNTS
</h4>
<div>
STRIPE provides escrow services to GPSI Clients and Consultants and Subject Matter Experts to
deliver, hold, or receive payment for a Project, and to make payments to GPSI (“Escrow Services”).
The Escrow Services are intended for business use, so you agree to use the Escrow Services for
business purposes and not for consumer, personal, family, or household purposes.
You hereby authorize and instruct STRIPE to act as escrow agent in connection with the Escrow
Accounts and the payment, holding, and receipt of funds for each Project and other specified
purposes (the “Escrow”) in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions.
</div>
<h4>
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CLIENT AND CONSULTANTS, AND SUBJECT
MATTER EXPERTS
MASTER SERVICE CONTRACTS
</h4>
<div>
You acknowledge and agree that a Master Service Agreement is comprised of the following
agreements (as applicable): (a) The Fixed-Price Escrow; (b) the Hourly, Bonus and Expense
Payment with Escrow; (c) Non Disclosure Agreement; (d) Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)
Statement; (e) the Project terms awarded and accepted on the Site to the extent that the terms if
applicable; and (f) any other contractual provisions accepted by both the Client and the
Consultant/Subject Matter Expert.
</div>
<h4>
5.2 PAYMENT AGREEMENTS AND ESCROW INSTRUCTIONS
</h4>
<div>
Fixed-Price Projects. If a Client and a Consultant/Subject Matter Expert choose fixed-price
compensation, then the Client and Consultant/Subject Matter Expert agree that they will be bound
by, and STRIPE will follow, the Fixed-Price Escrow Instructions.
Hourly Projects, Bonus Payments, or Expense Payments. If a Client and a Consultant/Subject Matter
Expert choose hourly compensation, and/or if the Client makes bonus or expense payments to the
Consultant/Subject Matter Expert, then the Client and Consultant/Subject Matter Expert agree that
they will be bound by, and STRIPE will follow, the Hourly, Bonus and Expense Payment Agreement
with Escrow Instructions.
</div>
<h4>
PAYMENT TERMS
SERVICE FEE
</h4>
<div>
When a Client pays a Consultant/Subject Matter Expert, or when funds related to a Project are
otherwise released to a Consultant/Subject Matter Expert as required by the applicable Escrow
Terms, STRIPE will credit the Consultant/Subject Matter Expert Escrow Account and then deduct
and disburse to GPSI a 10% service fee that GPSI earns for creating, hosting, maintaining, and
providing the Site and Site Services (the “Service Fee”). If Consultant/Subject Matter Expert elects
disbursement in foreign currency, STRIPE will add an additional conversion fee of 1.5% to the spot
rate quoted by its foreign exchange vendor and credit that amount to GPSI.
</div>
<h4>
MEMBERSHIP FEES
</h4>
<div>
Consultants and Subject Matter Experts register for free. Clients pay a monthly fee described at
https://appDemo1.com/pricing/, as may be revised from time to time upon such notice as may be
appropriate, and subject to the Terms of Service.
</div>
<h4>
NO FEE FOR INTRODUCING OR FOR FINDING PROJECTS
</h4>
<div>
GPSI does not introduce GPSI Clients to Consultants/Subject Matter Experts and does not help
Consultants/Subject Matter Experts secure Projects. GPSI merely makes the Site Services available
to enable Consultants and Subject Matter Experts to do so themselves. Therefore, GPSI does not
charge a fee when a Consultant/Subject Matter Expert finds a suitable Client or finds a Project.
However, Client and a Consultant/Subject Matter Expert are obligated to use the Site to pay and
receive payment for their work together if they identified each other through the Site, as detailed in
Section 7 (Non-Circumvention), below.
</div>
<h4>
DISBURSEMENTS TO CONSULTANTS AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS
</h4>
<div>
Under the relevant Escrow Instructions, STRIPE automatically disburses funds that are payable to
Consultant/Subject Matter Expert for the Project (less any applicable GPSI fees) to Consultants and
Subject Matter Experts (according to the payment instructions provided to GPSI) within 7 days after
the Client clicks “Accept and Make Payment.” Consultant/Subject Matter Expert agrees that it will not
receive interest or other earnings on the funds held by STRIPE prior to disbursement to
Consultant/Subject Matter Expert. For the avoidance of doubt, Consultant/Subject Matter Expert
further agrees STRIPE, GPSI, or our Affiliates may charge or deduct fees, may receive a reduction in
fees or expenses charged, and may receive other compensation from financial services firms and
other third parties in connection with the services they provide.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Escrow Instructions, and except as
prohibited by applicable law, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated the
conditions and restrictions of the Site or this Agreement, STRIPE may hold the disbursement of the
Consultant/Subject Matter Expert Fees. Additionally, STRIPE may also hold the disbursement of the
Consultant/Subject Matter Expert Fees if: (a) we require additional information, such as
Consultant/Subject Matter Expert’s tax information, government-issued identification, address, or
date of birth; (b) we have reason to believe the Consultant/Subject Matter Expert Fees may be
subject to dispute or chargeback; (c) we suspect fraud; (d) we believe there are reasonable grounds
for insecurity with respect to the performance of obligations under a Service Contract, this
Agreement, or other Terms of Service; (e) we deem necessary in connection with any investigation;
or (f) required by applicable law.
</div>
<div>
In cases of fraud, abuse, or violation of this Agreement, GPSI reserves the right to revoke any
payments and instruct STRIPE to (and STRIPE will have the right to) hold and/or reclaim from
STRIPE all Consultant/Subject Matter Expert Fees due to Consultant/Subject Matter Expert (not just
the Consultant/Subject Matter Expert Fees from the Service Contract(s) under investigation) unless
prohibited by applicable law. In addition, we reserve the right to seek reimbursement from you, and
you will reimburse us, if we suspect fraud or criminal activity associated with your payment,
withdrawal, or Project; if we discover erroneous or duplicate transactions; or if we have supplied our
services in accordance with this Agreement yet we receive any chargeback from the Payment
Method used by you, or used by your Client if you are a Consultant/Subject Matter Expert. You agree
that we have the right to obtain such reimbursement by instructing STRIPE to (and STRIPE will have
the right to) charge an applicable Escrow Account, and any other accounts you hold with us,
offsetting any amounts determined to be owing, deducting amounts from future payments or
withdrawals, charging your Payment Method, or obtaining reimbursement from you by any other
lawful means. Failure to pay for reimbursements of chargebacks is cause for termination of the
applicable Escrow Account.
</div>
<h4>
NON-PAYMENT
</h4>
<div>
If Client acting in bad faith fails to pay the Consultant/Subject Matter Expert Fees or any other
amounts due under this Agreement, whether by cancelling Client’s credit or debit card, initiating an
improper chargeback, or any other means, GPSI may suspend or close Client’s Account and revoke
Client’s access to the Site, including Client’s authority to use the Site to process any additional
payments or obtain any additional Consultant/Subject Matter Expert Services. Without limiting other
available remedies, Client must pay GPSI upon demand for amounts owed under this Agreement,
plus interest on the outstanding amount at the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month
or the maximum interest allowed by applicable law, plus attorneys’ fees and other costs of collection
to the extent permitted by applicable law. To the extent permitted by applicable law, GPSI or
STRIPE, at our discretion, may set off amounts due against other amounts received from or held by
GPSI or STRIPE for Client, make appropriate reports to credit reporting agencies and law
enforcement authorities, and cooperate with credit reporting agencies and law enforcement
authorities in any resulting investigation or prosecution.
</div>
<h4>
NO RETURN OF FUNDS
</h4>
<div>
Client acknowledges and agrees that STRIPE will charge Client’s designated Payment Method for
the Consultant/Subject Matter Expert Fees. Therefore, and in consideration of the Site Services
provided by GPSI and the Escrow Services provided by STRIPE, Client agrees that once STRIPE
charges Client’s designated Payment Method for the Consultant/Subject Matter Expert Fees as
provided in this Agreement, the charge is non-refundable, except as otherwise required by
applicable law. Client also acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement provides a dispute
resolution process as a way for Client resolve disputes. To the extent permitted by applicable law,
Client therefore agrees not to ask its credit card company, bank, or other Payment Method provider
to charge back any Consultant/Subject Matter Expert Fees or other Fees charged pursuant to this
Agreement for any reason. A chargeback in breach of the foregoing obligation is a material breach of
this Agreement. If Client initiates a chargeback in violation of this Agreement, Client agrees that
GPSI or STRIPE may dispute or appeal the chargeback and institute collection action against Client.
</div>
<h4>
FORMAL INVOICES AND TAXES
</h4>
<div>
GPSI will have no responsibility for determining the necessity of or for issuing any formal invoices, or
for determining, remitting, or withholding any taxes applicable to the Consultant/Subject Matter
Expert Fees. Consultant/Subject Matter Expert will be solely responsible for determining whether it is
required by applicable law to issue any formal invoices for the Consultant/Subject Matter Expert
Fees and for issuing any invoices so required. Consultant/Subject Matter Expert will also be solely
responsible for determining whether: (a) Consultant/Subject Matter Expert or GPSI is required by
applicable law to remit to the appropriate authorities any value added tax or any other taxes or
similar charges applicable to the Consultant/Subject Matter Expert Fees and remitting any such
taxes or charges to the appropriate authorities on behalf of itself or GPSI, as appropriate; and (b)
GPSI is required by applicable law to withhold any amount of the Consultant/Subject Matter Expert
Fees and for notifying GPSI of any such requirement and indemnifying GPSI (either by GPSI, at our
sole discretion, offsetting the relevant amount against a future payment of Consultant/Subject Matter
Expert Fees to Consultant/Subject Matter Expert or Consultant/Subject Matter Expert reimbursing
GPSI for the applicable amount) for any requirement to pay any withholding amount to the
appropriate authorities (including penalties and interest). In the event of an audit of GPSI,
Consultant/Subject Matter Expert agrees to promptly cooperate with GPSI and provide copies of
Consultant/Subject Matter Expert’s tax returns and other documents as may be reasonably
requested for purposes of such audit, including but not limited to records showing Consultant/Subject
Matter Expert is engaging in an independent business as represented to GPSI.
</div>
<div>
<h4>PAYMENT METHODS AND AUTOMATED CLEARINGHOUSE (ACH) DISPUTES</h4>
In order to use certain Site Services, Client must provide account information for at least one valid
Payment Method. Client hereby authorizes GPSI, and STRIPE to charge credit cards provided by
Client, or run Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) transactions; and to store credit card and banking or
other financial details as Client’s method of payment for Services (or any other Payment Method).
Please click here for additional terms and conditions that apply to STRIPE credit card transactions.
Disputes on ACH payments are fundamentally different than those on the credit card payments. If
the Client disputes a charge and the Client’s bank accepts the request to return the funds, STRIPE
immediately removes the funds for the charge from your Stripe account. Unlike credit card disputes,
Client is not able to contest ACH reversals. The Client will need to directly reach out to GPSI via
support@appDemo1.com to resolve the situation. For additional ACH terms and conditions that are the
responsibility of the client, including complying with all applicable laws such as prohibitions against
sending funds to sanctioned countries, entities, or persons please see https://stripe.com/achpayments/
terms.
</div>
<div>
When Client authorizes the payment of the Consultant/Subject Matter Expert Fees for a Fixed-Price
Contract on the Site, Client automatically and irrevocably authorizes and instructs STRIPE or GPSI,
LLC to charge Client’s Payment Method for the Consultant/Subject Matter Expert Fees. When Client
approves or is deemed to have approved a Deliverable for an Hourly Time and Materials Contract,
Client automatically and irrevocably authorizes and instructs STRIPE or GPSI, LLC to charge Client’s
Payment Method for the Consultant/Subject Matter Expert Fees including services and expenses.
By providing Payment Method information through the Site, Client represents, warrants, and
covenants that: (a) Client is legally authorized to provide such information to us; (b) Client is legally
authorized to perform payments using the Payment Method(s); and (c) such action does not violate
the terms and conditions applicable to Client’s use of such Payment Method(s) or applicable law.
When Client authorizes a payment using a Payment Method via the Site, Client represents, warrants,
and covenants that there are sufficient funds or credit available to complete the payment using the
designated Payment Method. To the extent that any amounts owed under this Agreement cannot be
collected from Client’s Payment Method(s), Client is solely responsible for paying such amounts by
other means.
</div>
<div>
By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to be bound by Stripe’s Terms and Conditions. Any breach of
those terms will be treated as a breach of these Terms. Client may terminate use of any of the
payment methods by sending an email to support@appDemo1.com.
</div>
<div>
<h4>
NON-CIRCUMVENTION BY CONTRACTORS AND CONSULTANTS INCLUDING SUBJECT
MATTER EXPERTS</h4>
You acknowledge and agree that a substantial portion of the compensation GPSI receives for
making the Site available to you is collected as a deduction of the Service Fee described Herein
(“Service Fee”). GPSI only deducts this Service Fee when a Client and a Consultant/Subject Matter
Expert pay and receive payment through the Site. Therefore, for 24 months from the time you are
identified by any party through the Site (the “Non-Circumvention Period”), you must use the Site
as your exclusive method to make and receive all payments for work directly or indirectly with that
party or arising out of your relationship with that party (the “GPSI Relationship”). Here, “identify”
includes via the Site’s search, filter, Unlock, and Shortlist tools.
</div>
<div>
Either the contractor or the consultant may opt-out of this obligation only if GPSI is paid:
(a) an “Opt-Out Fee” computed to be the greater of the following amounts: $2,500; or 15% of the
cost to the Client of the services to be performed in the GPSI Relationship during the Non-
Circumvention Period, as estimated in good faith by the prospective Client; or all Service Fees that
would be earned by GPSI from the GPSI Relationship during the Non-Circumvention Period,
computed based on the annualized amount you earn from Client during the most recent normalized
8-week period, or during such shorter period as data is available to GPSI; and
(b) interest at the rate of 18% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law,
whichever is less, calculated from the date Client first makes payment to you until the date the Opt-
Out Fee is paid.
</div>
<div>
Non-Circumvention does not apply if the contractor and consultant have an existing contractual
relationship before being identified through the Site. However, if the contractual relationship
occurred more than 24 months prior to identification, then this Non-Circumvention provision shall
apply and be enforced.
</div>
<div>
Non-Circumvention penalties and charges also do not apply to clients or consultants/SMEs if the
contractor hires the consultant/SME as a payroll employee under IRS definitions.
To pay the Opt-Out Fee, you must request instructions by sending an email message
to Support@app1url.com. Except if you pay the Opt-Out Fee, you agree not to circumvent the
Payment Methods offered by the Site. By way of illustration and not in limitation of the foregoing, you
must not:
<ul>
  <li>Submit quotes or solicit parties identified through the Site to contact, hire, work with, or pay
outside the Site.</li>
  <li>Accept projects or solicit parties identified through the Site to contact, deliver services,
invoice, or receive payment outside the Site.</li>
  <li>Invoice or report on the Site or in an Opt-Out Fee request an invoice or payment amount lower than that actually agreed between you and the Client. You agree to notify GPSI
immediately if another person improperly contacts you or suggests making or receiving
payments outside of the Site. If you are aware of a breach or potential breach of this noncircumvention
agreement, please submit a confidential report to GPSI by sending an email
message to: support@app1url.com. </li>

<div>
MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER (DOES NOT
APPLY TO USERS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND ITS TERRITORIES)
</div>
<div>
This Mandatory Binding Arbitration and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver provision (“Arbitration
Provision”) applies to all Users except Users located outside of the United States and its territories.
In the unlikely event the parties are unable to resolve a Claim within 60 days of the receipt of the
applicable Notice, you, GPSI, and our Affiliates agree to resolve the Claim by binding arbitration
before an arbitrator from AAA.
</div>
<h4>
Scope of Arbitration Agreement and Conduct of Arbitration
</h4>
<div>
Arbitration as provided in this Mandatory Binding Arbitration and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver
provision (“Arbitration Provision”) is governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.
§§ 1 et seq.). This Arbitration Provision applies to any Claim the parties may have and survives after
your relationship with GPSI ends. This Arbitration Provision is intended to apply to the resolution of
disputes that otherwise would be resolved in a court of law or before a forum other than arbitration. If
for any reason AAA will not administer the arbitration, either party may apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction with authority over the location where the arbitration will be conducted for appointment of
a neutral arbitrator.
</div>
<div>
Except as otherwise provided herein, arbitration will be conducted in Fairfax County, Virginia in
accordance with the AAA Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures under the Optional
Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for AAA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Claims
by Consultants/Subject Matter Experts that allege employment or worker classification claims will be
conducted within 25 miles of where the Consultant/Subject Matter Expert is located in accordance
with the AAA Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect. The AAA arbitration rules
may be found by searching online for “AAA Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures.” The
parties agree that any party will have the right to appear at the arbitration by telephone and/or video
rather than in person.
</div>
<div>
You and GPSI will follow the applicable AAA rules with respect to arbitration fees. In any arbitration
under the AAA Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedures, the Consultant/Subject Matter Expert
will pay AAA arbitration fees only to the extent those fees are no greater than the filing or initial
appearance fees applicable to court actions in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be
conducted. The arbitrator must follow applicable law and may award only those remedies that would
have applied had the matter been heard in court. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s
decision in any court having jurisdiction.
</div>
<div>
This Arbitration Provision does not apply to litigation between the Company and you to which you
are a party that is or was already pending in a state or federal court before the expiration of your optout
period. This Arbitration Provision does apply to claims for workers compensation, state disability
insurance or unemployment insurance benefits. Either you or GPSI may apply to a court of
competent jurisdiction for provisional injunctive relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy, but
only upon the ground that the award to which that party may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual
without such relief; the arbitrator will render the final judgment in the matter.
Regardless of any other terms of this Arbitration Provision, a claim may be brought by or to, and
remedies awarded by, an administrative agency not to exceed maximum allowable recovery
specified herein. Such administrative claims include without limitation claims or charges brought
before the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the
National Labor Relations Board. Nothing in this Arbitration Provision will be deemed to preclude or
excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the party’s
obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration, if any.
</div>
<h4>
Interpretation and Enforcement of this Arbitration Provision
</h4>
<div>
This Arbitration Provision is the full and complete agreement relating to the formal resolution of
Claims. For the avoidance of doubt, this Arbitration Provision covers, and the arbitrator shall have
exclusive jurisdiction to decide, all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation,
enforcement, or application of this Arbitration Provision, including the enforceability, revocability,
scope, or validity of the Arbitration Provision or any portion of the Arbitration Provision. All such
matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court. The parties expressly agree that the
arbitrator and not a court will decide any question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate, including
but not limited to any claim that all or part of this Agreement is void or voidable.
</div>
<div>
In the event any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this
Arbitration Provision will be enforceable. If any portion of the Class Action Waiver in subsection C,
below, of this Arbitration Provision is deemed to be unenforceable, you and GPSI agree that this
Arbitration Provision will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Class Action Waiver and Jury Trial Waiver
</div>
<div>
Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other
proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity aren’t allowed. Nor is combining
individual proceedings without the consent of all parties.
</div>
<div>
Both you and GPSI agree to bring any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a
class, collective, or representative basis on behalf of others. There will be no right or authority for
any dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class, collective, representative or private
attorney general action, or as a member in any such class, collective, representative or private
attorney general proceeding (“Class Action Waiver”). The Class Action Waiver does not prevent you
from bringing a Claim in arbitration as a private attorney general solely on your own behalf and not
on behalf of others.
</div>
<div>
Notwithstanding any other portion of this Arbitration Provision or the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will
have authority to hear any Claim on a class, collective, or representative basis if, only if, and only to
the extent that, the arbitrator determines that the waiver of such class, collective, or representative
Claim is unenforceable. You and GPSI agree that you will not be retaliated against, disciplined or
threatened with discipline as a result of exercising any rights under Section 7 of the National Labor
Relations Act by filing or participating in a class, collective or representative action in any forum.
However, GPSI may lawfully seek enforcement of this arbitration provision and the Class Action
Waiver under the Federal Arbitration Act and seek dismissal of such class, collective or
representative actions or claims.
